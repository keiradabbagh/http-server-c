# HTTP Server in C

This project is a simple HTTP server implemented in C as part of an advanced programming / systems course.

The server listens on a TCP socket, accepts incoming client connections, parses HTTP requests, and returns basic HTTP responses. The goal of the project was to gain hands-on experience with low-level networking, sockets, and concurrency fundamentals.

## Features
- TCP socket programming
- Handles basic HTTP GET requests
- Manual request parsing
- Lightweight and dependency-free
- Built using standard C and POSIX APIs

## Build Instructions

Make sure you have `gcc` installed.

```bash
make
